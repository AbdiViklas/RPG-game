/*theme ideas:
geeky obvious:
  dr. who
  lotr
  generic Tolien-esque RPG
  space
  Office Space style
  musicians
  tech theme--browsers? OSs?
  Greek mythology
  famous authors, musicians, etc. (e.g. Tolstoy vs Hemingway vs Jane Austen, or Beethoven vs Mahler vs Stravinsky...)
non-violent?
  two entities are starting with a set amount of X apiece and depleting each other's X...
  non-violent but combative: water balloons? & darts?
  helium balloons and darts!
  each combatant has an amount of chocolate that the other eats
  positive model: X is a person's "problems", and when two entities engage they deplete each other's problems
    But then the goal gets weird. When you engage with someone and they deplete all your problems wouldn't that be a good thing? Would the goal of this game be to be the only person left with problems?
